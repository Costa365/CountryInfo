## Country Information

Simple web page that allows the user to get country information based on 2 or 3 digit ISO country code. I created it because I couldn't find a tool that did exactly what I wanted.

It can be accessed here: http://costa365.rf.gd/countries/

The following is shown for each country:

- ISO 2
- ISO 3
- ISO Numeric
- Capital
- Area
- Population
- Continent
- Top Level Domain
- Currency Code
- Currency Name
- Phone

I edited this data to create the json fil ethat is used in this app.
